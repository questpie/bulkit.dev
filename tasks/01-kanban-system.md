# Task 01: Kanban System

## Overview
Build a comprehensive Kanban task management system that serves as the foundation for AI agent coordination and human collaboration. This system will manage hierarchical tasks with dependencies, real-time updates, and seamless integration with the multi-agent framework.

## Core Features

### 1. Task Management
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Tasks can have parent-child relationships for breaking down complex work
- **Task Dependencies**: Define blocking relationships between tasks (task A blocks task B)
- **Status Management**: Todo, In Progress, Review, Done, Blocked statuses
- **Assignment System**: Assign tasks to users or AI agents
- **Priority Levels**: High, Medium, Low, Critical priority settings
- **Due Dates**: Set deadlines for tasks with calendar integration
- **Labels & Tags**: Categorize tasks with customizable labels

### 2. Real-time Collaboration
- **Live Updates**: Real-time status changes across all connected clients
- **Drag & Drop**: Intuitive interface for moving tasks between columns
- **Bulk Operations**: Multi-select and batch operations on tasks
- **Activity Feed**: Track all changes and updates to tasks
- **Notifications**: Real-time notifications for task assignments and updates

### 3. Comments & Communication
- **Threaded Comments**: Nested comment system for task discussions
- **Mentions**: @mention users and AI agents in comments
- **Rich Text**: Markdown support for formatted comments
- **File Attachments**: Attach documents and media to tasks
- **AI Responses**: Automated responses from AI agents on task updates

### 4. Analytics & Reporting
- **Velocity Tracking**: Track team and individual task completion rates
- **Burndown Charts**: Visual progress tracking for projects
- **Time Tracking**: Optional time logging for tasks
- **Dependency Analysis**: Visualize task dependencies and bottlenecks
- **Agent Performance**: Track AI agent task completion metrics

## Database Schema

### Tasks Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  status TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('todo', 'in_progress', 'review', 'done', 'blocked')),
  priority TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (priority IN ('low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical')),
  
  -- Hierarchy
  parent_task_id TEXT REFERENCES tasks(id),
  order_index INTEGER NOT NULL,
  
  -- Assignment
  assigned_to_user_id TEXT REFERENCES users(id),
  assigned_to_agent_id TEXT REFERENCES agents(id),
  
  -- Scheduling
  due_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  started_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  
  -- Organization
  organization_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id),
  project_id TEXT REFERENCES projects(id),
  
  -- Metadata
  created_by_user_id TEXT REFERENCES users(id),
  created_by_agent_id TEXT REFERENCES agents(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Task Dependencies Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE task_dependencies (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  blocking_task_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES tasks(id),
  blocked_task_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES tasks(id),
  dependency_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (dependency_type IN ('finish_to_start', 'start_to_start', 'finish_to_finish')),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(blocking_task_id, blocked_task_id)
);
```

### Task Labels Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE task_labels (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  task_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES tasks(id),
  label_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES labels(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(task_id, label_id)
);

CREATE TABLE labels (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  color TEXT NOT NULL,
  organization_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(name, organization_id)
);
```

## API Endpoints

### Task CRUD Operations
- `GET /api/tasks` - List tasks with filtering and pagination
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create new task
- `GET /api/tasks/:id` - Get task details with subtasks and dependencies
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id` - Update task
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Delete task and handle dependencies

### Task Operations
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/assign` - Assign task to user or agent
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/move` - Move task to different status/position
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/dependencies` - Add task dependency
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id/dependencies/:depId` - Remove dependency

### Bulk Operations
- `POST /api/tasks/bulk/update` - Update multiple tasks
- `POST /api/tasks/bulk/assign` - Assign multiple tasks
- `POST /api/tasks/bulk/move` - Move multiple tasks

## Frontend Components

### Core Components
- `KanbanBoard` - Main board with columns and drag-drop
- `TaskCard` - Individual task card with actions
- `TaskModal` - Detailed task view with editing
- `TaskForm` - Create/edit task form
- `DependencyGraph` - Visual dependency relationships

### Real-time Features
- WebSocket integration for live updates
- Optimistic updates for smooth UX
- Conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- Auto-save functionality

### Mobile Responsive
- Touch-friendly drag and drop
- Responsive layout for mobile devices
- Offline capability with sync

## Integration Points

### AI Agent Integration
- Tasks can be assigned to AI agents
- Agents can create subtasks automatically
- Agent activity logging in task comments
- Status updates from agent operations

### Post Management Integration
- Link tasks to social media posts
- Automatic task creation for post workflows
- Post performance tracking in tasks

### User Management
- Role-based permissions (admin, manager, member)
- Team assignment and workload balancing
- User activity tracking

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Services
- `TasksService` - Core task management logic
- `DependencyService` - Dependency management and validation
- `NotificationService` - Real-time notifications
- `ActivityService` - Change tracking and logging

### Frontend Queries
- React Query for data fetching and caching
- Infinite scroll for large task lists
- Optimistic updates for immediate feedback
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates

### Performance Considerations
- Database indexing for common queries
- Pagination for large datasets
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Efficient dependency resolution algorithms

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can create hierarchical tasks with parent-child relationships
- [ ] Task dependencies prevent invalid status transitions
- [ ] Real-time updates work across all connected clients
- [ ] Drag and drop interface works smoothly

- [ ] Comments system supports threading and mentions
- [ ] Analytics dashboard shows meaningful metrics
- [ ] System handles concurrent edits gracefully
- [ ] Mobile interface is fully functional
- [ ] Performance remains good with 1000+ tasks

## Dependencies
- Requires user authentication system
- Needs real-time infrastructure (WebSockets/Pusher)
- Depends on organization/project structure
- Integrates with upcoming AI agent system

## Estimated Timeline
- Database schema and migrations: 2 days
